### CI/CD for Machine Learning
Discover how to automate the entire machine learning workflow, including model training, evaluation, versioning, and deployment, using GitHub Actions. This is the simplest MLOps guide available online.

### Project Overview:
In this project, we will leverage scikit-learn pipelines to train a random forest algorithm and create a drug classification model. The evaluation process will be automated using Continuous Machine Learning (CML), and the final step will be deploying a web application to Hugging Face Hub.

The entire workflow—from training to evaluation—will be automated with GitHub Actions. Simply push your code to the GitHub repository, and within two minutes, the updated model, app, and results will be deployed to Hugging Face.
